# Reflection

This exercise relies on Wikipedia to turn a simple text table into "linked data". In the following exercies, you'll be asked to think about where this model can and cannot be replicated. You will robalby want to use markdown source blocks and tables in some of your ansers.  You can create a table with vertical pipes:

```markdown
Header 1 | Header 2
---------+---------
Content cell 1 | Content Cell 2
Content Row 2 | Content Row 2
```

The block above uses fenced code blocks to show the table syntax.  

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### Our underlying dataset was a list of prime ministers. Describe another possible dataset which could use Wikipedia in the same way. Give an example of a possible Javascript object description of one record in the dataset, using the Javscript objects from Part 1, problem 2, as a starting point.

## Question 2 (150 words)
#### Now describe another dataset for which Wikipedia would not be as good a resource. What does this tell you about the limitations of Wikipedia? WHat kind of work would you need to do to make useful links for this dataset?

## Question 3 (150 words)
#### Finally, describe another dataset which would not easily be represented i nthis kind of table. What does this example tell you about the limitations of data-based historical/humanistic inquiry?
